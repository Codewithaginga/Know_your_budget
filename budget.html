                <h3>Why Budgeting?</h3>
                <p>Helps you plan your spending: Budgeting allows you 
                    to track your income and expenses, so you can plan
                    your spending accordingly. It helps you identify areas
                    where you may be overspending, and where you can cut back
                .</p>
                <p>
                    Helps you achieve your financial goals: By creating a budget, you can set financial goals and create a plan to achieve them. Whether it's saving for a down payment on a house or paying off debt, budgeting helps you stay on track and work towards your goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Helps you avoid debt: By knowing how much you can afford to spend, you can avoid overspending and taking on debt. Budgeting allows you to prioritize your expenses and make sure you have enough money to cover your bills and other financial obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Helps you prepare for emergencies: By creating an emergency fund as part of your budget, you can prepare for unexpected expenses like car repairs or medical bills. This can help you avoid taking on debt or dipping into your savings to cover these expenses.
